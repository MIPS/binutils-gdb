	* ada-lang.c (process_raise_exception_name): Remove extraneous 
        definition from unsubmitted code.

	(is_lower_alphanum): New function.
	(ada_decode):  Add support for decoding protected object subprograms
	and entries, and of entities declared inside protected object
	subprograms. 
	Also add missing handling for__{DIGITS}+ suffixes.
	Allow '$<digits>' as valid overloading suffix.
	(is_name_suffix): Add handling for protected type entriy suffixes.
	Also add support for protected type subprogram suffixes, but keep
	it commented out for now, as there is an ambiguity between these
	entities and other internally generated entities.
	Allow '$<digits>' as valid overloading suffix.
	(is_valid_name_for_wild_match): New function.
	(wild_match): Add an exra level of verification of the entity name
	before declaring it a match for the given pattern.

	(ada_type_of_array, ada_evaluate_subexp): Use more proper 
	longest_to_int rather than cast.

	(ada_evaluate_subexp): Use "invalid" rather than "illegal" in comment.

	(ada_coerce_to_simple_array): Call check_size to make sure
	that the object size is reasonable.

	(ada_value_primitive_packed_val):  Use correct location in target 
	buffer for extracting packed record fields that are themselves records.

	(add_defn_to_vec): Do not try to replace a stub type by its full
	type. Avoids a potential infinite loop.
	
	(ada_lookup_symbol): Move return incorrectly placed return statement, 
	causing a loop that should be scanning all object files to only 
	scan the first one.

	(ada_tag_name_2): New function.
	(ada_tag_name_1): If no 'tsd' field found in the dispatching table,
	use alternative representation.

	(ada_find_renaming_symbol): Strip the function name suffix when 
	computing the XR type name.

	(ada_to_fixed_type): Try determining the tag only if we have the
	object's address.
	(to_fixed_array_type): Add comments.

	(ada_check_typedef): Replace expression checking whether the given
	type is a stub or not by a "call" to TYPE_STUB. Clearer and more
	consistent.
	
	* ada-lang.h (ADA_KNOWN_AUXILIARY_FUNCTION_NAME_PATTERNS): Allow
	'$' in addition to '.' for runtime auxiliary function name suffixes.
	See changes to ada_decode above.

	(struct task_control_block): Add field called_task.  (This change is
	to keep synchronized with our local sources; it does not affect the
	public version yet.)

	* ada-typeprint.c (ada_print_type): Use int_string for printing
	modulus of modular type.
	
	(print_range): Trivial editorial comment fix.

	* ada-valprint.c (ada_emit_char): Use normal Ada syntax for 
	double quote in string.
