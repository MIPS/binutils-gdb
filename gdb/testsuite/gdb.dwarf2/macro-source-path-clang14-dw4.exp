# The do_test proc comes from macro-source-path.exp.tcl.
source $srcdir/$subdir/macro-source-path.exp.tcl

# When adding a test here, please consider adding an equivalent case to
# `gdb.base/macro-source-path.exp`.

# The following tests are based on the output of `clang-14 -gdwarf-4
# -fdebug-macro -g3 <file>` (using its built-in assembler).  With -gdwarf-4,
# clang produces a .debug_macinfo section, not a .debug_macro section.  But
# this test still creates a .debug_macro section, that's good enough for what
# we want to test.
