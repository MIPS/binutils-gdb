     INIT_EXTRA_FRAME_INFO is called from two places: create_new_frame
     (where the PC is already set up) and here (where it isn't).
     DEPRECATED_INIT_FRAME_PC is only called from here, always after
     INIT_EXTRA_FRAME_INFO.

     The catch is the MIPS, where INIT_EXTRA_FRAME_INFO requires the
     PC value (which hasn't been set yet).  Some other machines appear
     to require INIT_EXTRA_FRAME_INFO before they can do
     DEPRECATED_INIT_FRAME_PC.  Phoo.

     We shouldn't need DEPRECATED_INIT_FRAME_PC_FIRST to add more
     complication to an already overcomplicated part of GDB.
     gnu@cygnus.com, 15Sep92.

     Assuming that some machines need DEPRECATED_INIT_FRAME_PC after
     INIT_EXTRA_FRAME_INFO, one possible scheme:

     SETUP_INNERMOST_FRAME(): Default version is just create_new_frame
     (read_fp ()), read_pc ()).  Machines with extra frame info would
     do that (or the local equivalent) and then set the extra fields.

     SETUP_ARBITRARY_FRAME(argc, argv): Only change here is that
     create_new_frame would no longer init extra frame info;
     SETUP_ARBITRARY_FRAME would have to do that.

     INIT_PREV_FRAME(fromleaf, prev) Replace INIT_EXTRA_FRAME_INFO and
     DEPRECATED_INIT_FRAME_PC.  This should also return a flag saying
     whether to keep the new frame, or whether to discard it, because
     on some machines (e.g.  mips) it is really awkward to have
     FRAME_CHAIN_VALID called *before* INIT_EXTRA_FRAME_INFO (there is
     no good way to get information deduced in FRAME_CHAIN_VALID into
     the extra fields of the new frame).  std_frame_pc(fromleaf, prev)

     This is the default setting for INIT_PREV_FRAME.  It just does
     what the default DEPRECATED_INIT_FRAME_PC does.  Some machines
     will call it from INIT_PREV_FRAME (either at the beginning, the
     end, or in the middle).  Some machines won't use it.

  /* NOTE: cagney/2002-11-09: Just ignore the above!  There is no
     reason for things to be this complicated.

     The trick is to assume that there is always a frame.  Instead of
     special casing the inner-most frame, create fake frame
     (containing the hardware registers) that is inner to the
     user-visible inner-most frame (...) and then unwind from that.
     That way architecture code can use use the standard
     frame_XX_unwind() functions and not differentiate between the
     inner most and any other case.

     Since there is always a frame to unwind from, there is always
     somewhere (NEXT_FRAME) to store all the info needed to construct
     a new (previous) frame without having to first create it.  This
     means that the convolution below - needing to carefully order a
     frame's initialization - isn't needed.

     The irony here though, is that FRAME_CHAIN(), at least for a more
     up-to-date architecture, always calls FRAME_SAVED_PC(), and
     FRAME_SAVED_PC() computes the PC but without first needing the
     frame!  Instead of the convolution below, we could have simply
     called FRAME_SAVED_PC() and been done with it!  Note that
