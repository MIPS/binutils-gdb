1) You can't exit at the end with CTRL-D, the process has to be killed. Typing
"q" just makes it hang.

2) The inferior can't accept input (on the same terminal):

-exec-run
^running
(gdb)
Enter value for n1 : 5
Enter value for n2 :
Suspended (tty input)

This also happens with Apple's GDB but I don't understand it.
