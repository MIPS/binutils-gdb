/* Decode the Line Number Program (LNP) for the given line_header
   structure and CU.  The actual information extracted and the type
   of structures created from the LNP depends on the value of PST.

   FND holds the CU file name and directory, if known.
   It is used for relative paths in the line table.

   NOTE: It is important that psymtabs have the same file name (via
   strcmp) as the corresponding symtab.  Since the directory is not
   used in the name of the symtab we don't use it in the name of the
   psymtabs we create.  E.g. expand_line_sal requires this when
   finding psymtabs to expand.  A good testcase for this is
   mb-inline.exp.

   LOWPC is the lowest address in CU (or 0 if not known).

   Boolean DECODE_MAPPING specifies we need to fully decode .debug_line
   for its PC<->lines mapping information.  Otherwise only the filename
   table is read in.  */
