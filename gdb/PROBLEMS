		Known problems in GDB 5.1

See also the bug database http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/bugs/


hppa2.0-hp-hpux10.20

Due to a problem (conflicting types) with libiberty/regex.c, GDB 5.1
does not build on HP/UX 10.20 when using the HP supplied compiler.

Due to bit rot, GDB 5.1 does not work on HP/UX 10.20 when built with
GCC.


hppa2.0w-hp-hpux11.00

Due to a problem with ltconfig and long argument lines, GDB 5.1 does
not configure on HP/UX 11.00.


alpha-dec-osf5.1

GDB 5.1 has a number of problems on this platform (Ref PR gdb/237).  A
GDB 5.1 built with ``CC="cc -DUSE_LDR_ROUTINES"'' is reported to work
much better.


alpha-dec-osf4.0e

GDB 5.1 is known to have problems on this platform (encounters an
internal error in the symbol table reader).


sparcv9-sun-solaris2.8

There are known problems with building GDB 5.1 using GCC 3.0.x for the
64 bit SPARC target (bad code gen).  You could try a development
version of GCC.


i586-sco-sysv5uw7.1.1

There are known problems with GDB 5.1's thread support on this
platform.  Non-threaded programs should work.


*-*-*

GDB 5.1 assumes that the host C compiler implemends alloca().  GCC is
one such compiler.  This problem should be fixed on the trunk.
