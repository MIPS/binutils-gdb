			Known problems in GDB 5.3

		See also: http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/bugs/


*-*-freebsd*
---------------

Due to a kernel bug (kern/35175), detaching from an attached process
will very likely cause the process to be stop or die with a Trace/BPT
trap.


i386-*-freebsd[34]*
-------------------

There is a bug (bin/41671) in FreeBSD's gcc that causes it to emit bad
debug information when using the stabs format (which is the default).
In earlier versions of GDB the effects were rather limited, but
starting with GDB 5.3 the influence is much more prominent.


hppa2.0-hp-hpux10.20
--------------------

gdb/487: The top level make files used to build GDB are not compatible
with HP/UX make.  As a workaround, use GNU make.

gdb/486: The HP/UX C compiler defaults to K&R mode but GDB only builds
with an ISO C compiler.  The top level configuration incorrectly sets
CC to `cc' instead of `cc -Ae'.  As a workaround, the correct compiler
can be specified as part of the configuration vis:

    $  'CC=cc -Ae' ./configure


s390*-*-*
---------

gdb/513: GDB does not build on s390 GNU/Linux.  The problem should be
fixed in more recent sources.


i386-*-freebsd4.4*
------------------

gdb/455: GDB doesn't build on a FreeBSD 4.4-STABLE system.  The
problem is still being investigated.
