hppa2.0-hp-hpux10.20
--------------------

gdb/487: The top level make files used to build GDB are not compatible
with HP/UX make.  As a workaround, use GNU make.

gdb/486: The HP/UX C compiler defaults to K&R mode but GDB only builds
with an ISO C compiler.  The top level configuration incorrectly sets
CC to `cc' instead of `cc -Ae'.  As a workaround, the correct compiler
can be specified as part of the configuration vis:

    $  'CC=cc -Ae' ./configure
