need to review ASTAT write behavior

how to model RETE and IVG0 bit in IPEND ...

model the loop buffer ?  this means no ifetches because they're cached.
see page 4-26 in Blackfin PRM under hardware loops.

handle DSPID at 0xffe05000

CEC should handle multiple exceptions at same address.  would need
exception processing to be delayed ?  at least needs a stack for
the CEC to pop things off.

R0 = [SP++]; gets traced as R0 = [P6++];

merge dv-bfin_evt with dv-bfin_cec since the EVT regs are part of the CEC

fix single stepping over debug assert instructions in hardware

exception in IVG5 causes double fault ?

add a "file" option to the async banks to back it

tests:
	- check AN bits with Dreg subtraction
		R0 = R1 - R2;
	- check astat bits with vector add/sub +|+
	- check acc with VIT_MAX and similiar insns
