@node nanoMIPS Options
@section Assembler options

The nanoMIPS configurations of @sc{gnu} @code{@value{AS}} support these
special options:

@table @code
@cindex @code{-G} option (nanoMIPS)
@item -G @var{num}
Set the ``small data'' limit to @var{n} bytes.  The default limit is 8 bytes.
@xref{nanoMIPS Small Data,, Controlling the use of small data accesses}.

@cindex @code{-EB} option (nanoMIPS)
@cindex @code{-EL} option (nanoMIPS)
@cindex nanoMIPS big-endian output
@cindex nanoMIPS little-endian output
@cindex big-endian output, nanoMIPS
@cindex little-endian output, nanoMIPS
@item -EB
@itemx -EL
Any nanoMIPS configuration of @code{@value{AS}} can select big-endian or
little-endian output at run time (unlike the other @sc{gnu} development
tools, which must be configured for one or the other).  Use @samp{-EB}
to select big-endian output, and @samp{-EL} for little-endian.

@item -mpic
@itemx -mno-pic
Generate medium-model SVR4-style PIC.  This option tells the assembler
to generate SVR4-style position-independent macro expansions.  It also
tells the assembler to mark the output file as PIC.
@samp{-mno-pic} turns off this option.

@item -mdsp
@itemx -mno-dsp
Generate code for the DSP Application Specific Extension. This tells
the assembler to accept DSP instructions. Since the lowest Release
version of DSP ASE supported by nanoMIPS is Release 3, this option is
equivalent to @samp{-mdspr3}.
@samp{-mno-dsp} turns off this option. This option is equivalent to
@samp{-mno-dspr3}.

@item -mdspr3
@itemx -mno-dspr3
Generate code for the DSP Release 3 Application Specific Extension.
This tells the assembler to accept DSP Release 3 instructions.
@samp{-mno-dspr3} turns off this option.

@item -mmt
@itemx -mno-mt
Generate code for the MT Application Specific Extension.
This tells the assembler to accept MT instructions.
@samp{-mno-mt} turns off this option.

@item -mmcu
@itemx -mno-mcu
Generate code for the MCU Application Specific Extension.
This tells the assembler to accept MCU instructions.
@samp{-mno-mcu} turns off this option.

@item -mmsa
@itemx -mno-msa
Generate code for the nanoMIPS SIMD Architecture Extension.
This tells the assembler to accept MSA instructions.
@samp{-mno-msa} turns off this option.

@item -mxpa
@itemx -mno-xpa
Generate code for the nanoMIPS eXtended Physical Address (XPA) Extension.
This tells the assembler to accept XPA instructions.
@samp{-mno-xpa} turns off this option.

@item -mvirt
@itemx -mno-virt
Generate code for the Virtualization Application Specific Extension.
This tells the assembler to accept Virtualization instructions.
@samp{-mno-virt} turns off this option.

@item -mginv
@itemx -mno-ginv
Generate code for the Global cache INValidate Application Specific Extension.
This tells the assembler to accept GINV instructions.
@samp{-mno-ginv} turns off this option.

@item -mtlb
@itemx -mno-tlb
Generate code for the Translation Lookaside Buffer control extension.
This tells the assembler to accept TLB control instructions.
@samp{-mno-tlb} turns off this option.

@item -minsn32
@itemx -mno-insn32
Only use 32-bit instruction encodings when generating code for the
microMIPS processor.  This option inhibits the use of any 16-bit
instructions.  This is equivalent to putting @code{.set insn32} at
the start of the assembly file.  @samp{-mno-insn32} turns off this
option.  This is equivalent to putting @code{.set noinsn32} at the
start of the assembly file.  By default @samp{-mno-insn32} is
selected, allowing all instructions to be used.

@item -march=@var{arch}
Generate code for a particular nanoMIPS @var{arch}, which can be the name of a generic nanoMIPS @var{ISA} or the name of a particular @var{CPU}. Valid @var{ISA} value are: 

@quotation
32r6,
32r6s,
64r6
@end quotation

Valid @var{CPU} value are:

@quotation
i7200,
m7000
@end quotation

@item -m32
Generate code for the p32 ABI.

@item -m64
Generate code for the p64 ABI.

@item -mtune=@var{cpu}
Schedule and tune for a particular nanoMIPS CPU.  Valid @var{cpu} values are
identical to @samp{-march=@var{cpu}}.

@item -msym32
@itemx -mno-sym32
@cindex -msym32
@cindex -mno-sym32
Equivalent to adding @code{.set sym32} or @code{.set nosym32} to
the beginning of the assembler input.  @xref{nanoMIPS Symbol Sizes}.

@cindex @code{-nocpp} ignored (nanoMIPS)
@item -nocpp
This option is ignored.  It is accepted for command-line compatibility with
other assemblers, which use it to turn off C style preprocessing.  With
@sc{gnu} @code{@value{AS}}, there is no need for @samp{-nocpp}, because the
@sc{gnu} assembler itself never runs the C preprocessor.

@item -msoft-float
@itemx -mhard-float
Disable or enable floating-point instructions.  Note that by default
floating-point instructions are always allowed even with CPU targets
that don't have support for these instructions.

@item -msingle-float
@itemx -mdouble-float
Disable or enable double-precision floating-point operations.  Note
that by default double-precision floating-point operations are always
allowed even with CPU targets that don't have support for these
operations.

@item --construct-floats
@itemx --no-construct-floats
The @code{--no-construct-floats} option disables the construction of
double width floating point constants by loading the two halves of the
value into the two single width floating point registers that make up
the double width register.  This feature is useful if the processor
support the FR bit in its status  register, and this bit is known (by
the programmer) to be set.  This bit prevents the aliasing of the double
width register by the single width registers.

By default @code{--construct-floats} is selected, allowing construction
of these floating point constants.

@item --relax-branch
@itemx --no-relax-branch
The @samp{--relax-branch} option enables the relaxation of out-of-range
branches.  Any branches whose target cannot be reached directly are
converted to a small instruction sequence including an inverse-condition
branch to the physically next instruction, and a jump to the original
target is inserted between the two instructions.  In PIC code the jump
will involve further instructions for address calculation.

The @code{BC1ANY2F}, @code{BC1ANY2T}, @code{BC1ANY4F}, @code{BC1ANY4T},
@code{BPOSGE32} and @code{BPOSGE64} instructions are excluded from
relaxation, because they have no complementing counterparts.  They could
be relaxed with the use of a longer sequence involving another branch,
however this has not been implemented and if their target turns out of
reach, they produce an error even if branch relaxation is enabled.

Also no nanoMIPS16 branches are ever relaxed.

By default @samp{--no-relax-branch} is selected, causing any out-of-range
branches to produce an error.

@item --trap
@itemx --no-break
@c FIXME!  (1) reflect these options (next item too) in option summaries;
@c         (2) stop teasing, say _which_ instructions expanded _how_.
@code{@value{AS}} automatically macro expands certain division and
multiplication instructions to check for overflow and division by zero.  This
option causes @code{@value{AS}} to generate code to take a trap exception
rather than a break exception when an error is detected.  The trap instructions
are only supported at Instruction Set Architecture level 2 and higher.

@item --break
@itemx --no-trap
Generate code to take a break exception rather than a trap exception when an
error is detected.  This is the default.

@item -mbalc-stubs
@itemx -mno-balc-stubs
Consolidate multiple out-of-range call instructions to a function to
16-bit calls to a stub with transfers control to the function. The
@samp{-mbalc-stubs} option improves code compression at the cost
of performance, since each transformed call requires two control
transfers.

This optimization is disabled by default.

@item -mlegacyregs
Allow the use of legacy MIPS style numeric register formats in 
nanoMIPS assembly.

@item --linkrelax
Enable link-time relaxation features. The assembler will generate
additional reloctions to allow the linker to expand/relax object
code and fix-up for correctness. FIXME: Ref to .set options.
@end table

@node nanoMIPS Macros
@section High-level assembly macros

MIPS assemblers have traditionally provided a wider range of
instructions than the MIPS architecture itself.  These extra
instructions are usually referred to as ``macro'' instructions
@footnote{The term ``macro'' is somewhat overloaded here, since
these macros have no relation to those defined by @code{.macro},
@pxref{Macro,, @code{.macro}}.}. nanoMIPS assembler continues
support for many traditionally supported instructions.

Some nanoMIPS macro instructions extend an underlying architectural instruction
while others are entirely new.  An example of the former type is @code{and},
which allows the third operand to be either a register or an arbitrary
immediate value.  Examples of the latter type include @code{bgt}, which
branches to the third operand when the first operand is greater than
the second operand.

One of the most common extensions provided by macros is to expand
memory offsets to the full address range (32 or 64 bits) and to allow
symbolic offsets such as @samp{my_data + 4} to be used in place of
integer constants.  For example, the architectural instruction
@code{lbu} allows only an unsigned 12-bit offset, whereas the macro
@code{lbu} allows code such as @samp{lbu $4,array+32769($5)}.
The implementation of these symbolic offsets depends on several factors,
such as whether the assembler is generating SVR4-style PIC (selected by
@option{-mpic}, @pxref{nanoMIPS Options,, Assembler options}), the size of symbols
(@pxref{nanoMIPS Symbol Sizes,, Directives to override the size of symbols}),
and the small data limit (@pxref{nanoMIPS Small Data,, Controlling the use
of small data accesses}).

@kindex @code{.set macro}
@kindex @code{.set nomacro}
It is undesirable to have one assembly instruction expand
to several machine instructions.  The directive @code{.set nomacro}
tells the assembler to prohibit such expansions.  @code{.set macro}
restores the default behavior.

@cindex @code{at} register, nanoMIPS
@kindex @code{.set at=@var{reg}}
Some macro instructions need a temporary register to store intermediate
results.  This register is usually @code{$1}, also known as @code{$at},
but it can be changed to any core register @var{reg} using
@code{.set at=@var{reg}}.  Note that @code{$at} always refers
to @code{$1} regardless of which register is being used as the
temporary register.

@kindex @code{.set at}
@kindex @code{.set noat}
Implicit uses of the temporary register in macros could interfere with
explicit uses in the assembly code.  The assembler therefore warns
whenever it sees an explicit use of the temporary register.  The directive
@code{.set noat} silences this warning while @code{.set at} restores
the default behavior.  It is safe to use @code{.set noat} while
@code{.set nomacro} is in effect since single-instruction macros
never need a temporary register.

Note that while the @sc{gnu} assembler provides these macros for compatibility,
it does not make any attempt to optimize them with the surrounding code.

@node nanoMIPS Symbol Sizes
@section Directives to override the size of symbols

@kindex @code{.set sym32}
@kindex @code{.set nosym32}
The p64 ABI allows symbols to have any 64-bit value.  Although this
provides a great deal of flexibility, it means that some macros have
much longer expansions than their 32-bit counterparts.  For example,
the non-PIC expansion of @samp{dla $4,sym} is usually:

@smallexample
lui     $4,%highest(sym)
lui     $1,%hi(sym)
daddiu  $4,$4,%higher(sym)
daddiu  $1,$1,%lo(sym)
dsll32  $4,$4,0
daddu   $4,$4,$1
@end smallexample

whereas the 32-bit expansion is simply:

@smallexample
lui     $4,%hi(sym)
daddiu  $4,$4,%lo(sym)
@end smallexample

p64 code is sometimes constructed in such a way that all symbolic
constants are known to have 32-bit values, and in such cases, it's
preferable to use the 32-bit expansion instead of the 64-bit
expansion.

You can use the @code{.set sym32} directive to tell the assembler
that, from this point on, all expressions of the form
@samp{@var{symbol}} or @samp{@var{symbol} + @var{offset}}
have 32-bit values.  For example:

@smallexample
.set sym32
dla     $4,sym
lw      $4,sym+16
sw      $4,sym+0x8000($4)
@end smallexample

will cause the assembler to treat @samp{sym}, @code{sym+16} and
@code{sym+0x8000} as 32-bit values.  The handling of non-symbolic
addresses is not affected.

The directive @code{.set nosym32} ends a @code{.set sym32} block and
reverts to the normal behavior.  It is also possible to change the
symbol size using the command-line options @option{-msym32} and
@option{-mno-sym32}.

These options and directives are always accepted, but at present,
they have no effect for anything other than p64.

@node nanoMIPS Small Data
@section Controlling the use of small data accesses

@cindex small data, nanoMIPS
@cindex @code{gp} register, nanoMIPS
It often takes several instructions to load the address of a symbol.
For example, when @samp{addr} is a 32-bit symbol, the non-PIC expansion
of @samp{dla $4,addr} is usually:

@smallexample
lui     $4,%hi(addr)
daddiu  $4,$4,%lo(addr)
@end smallexample

The sequence is much longer when @samp{addr} is a 64-bit symbol.
@xref{nanoMIPS Symbol Sizes,, Directives to override the size of symbols}.

In order to cut down on this overhead, most embedded nanoMIPS systems
set aside a 64-kilobyte ``small data'' area and guarantee that all
data of size @var{n} and smaller will be placed in that area.
The limit @var{n} is passed to both the assembler and the linker
using the command-line option @option{-G @var{n}}, @pxref{nanoMIPS Options,,
Assembler options}.  Note that the same value of @var{n} must be used
when linking and when assembling all input files to the link; any
inconsistency could cause a relocation overflow error.

The size of an object in the @code{.bss} section is set by the
@code{.comm} or @code{.lcomm} directive that defines it.  The size of
an external object may be set with the @code{.extern} directive.  For
example, @samp{.extern sym,4} declares that the object at @code{sym}
is 4 bytes in length, while leaving @code{sym} otherwise undefined.

When no @option{-G} option is given, the default limit is 8 bytes.
The option @option{-G 0} prevents any data from being automatically
classified as small.

It is also possible to mark specific objects as small by putting them
in the special sections @code{.sdata} and @code{.sbss}, which are
``small'' counterparts of @code{.data} and @code{.bss} respectively.
The toolchain will treat such data as small regardless of the
@option{-G} setting.

On startup, systems that support a small data area are expected to
initialize register @code{$28}, also known as @code{$gp}, in such a
way that small data can be accessed using a 16-bit offset from that
register.  For example, when @samp{addr} is small data,
the @samp{dla $4,addr} instruction above is equivalent to:

@smallexample
daddiu  $4,$28,%gp_rel(addr)
@end smallexample

Small data is not supported for SVR4-style PIC.

@node nanoMIPS ISA
@section Directives to override the ISA level

@cindex nanoMIPS CPU override
@kindex @code{.set arch=@var{cpu}}
The @code{.set arch=@var{cpu}} directive provides even finer control.
It changes the effective CPU target and allows the assembler to use
instructions specific to a particular CPU.  All CPUs supported by the
@samp{-march} command line option are also selectable by this directive.
The original value is restored by @code{.set arch=default}.

@node nanoMIPS assembly options
@section Directives to control code generation

@cindex nanoMIPS directives to override command line options
@kindex @code{.module}
The @code{.module} directive allows command line options to be set directly
from assembly.  The format of the directive matches the @code{.set}
directive but only those options which are relevant to a whole module are
supported.  The effect of a @code{.module} directive is the same as the
corresponding command line option.  Where @code{.set} directives support
returning to a default then the @code{.module} directives do not as they
define the defaults.

These module-level directives must appear first in assembly.

@cindex nanoMIPS 32-bit microMIPS instruction generation override
@kindex @code{.set insn32}
@kindex @code{.set noinsn32}
The directive @code{.set insn32} makes the assembler only use 32-bit
instruction encodings when generating code for the microMIPS processor.
This directive inhibits the use of any 16-bit instructions from that
point on in the assembly.  The @code{.set noinsn32} directive allows
16-bit instructions to be accepted.

@cindex Control code/data memory models
@kindex @code{.set mcmodel=auto}
@kindex @code{.set mcmodel=small}
@kindex @code{.set mcmodel=large}
These directives specify the memory model that the assembler may
assume for generating macros. The directive @code{.set mcmodel=auto}
defers most decisions about the range of the code/data layout to
link-time relaxation. It requires linker relaxation to be enabled and
a capable linker. The directive @code{.set mcmodel=small} assumes that
the GP-relative region (which includes the GOT) must not exceed 2MiB
and the total code size for a final link must not exceed 32MiB. The
directive @code{.set mcmodel=large} implies no limits<FIXME not true for
64-bits, perhaps specify a 2GB limit>.

@node nanoMIPS insn
@section Directive to mark data as an instruction

@kindex @code{.insn}
The @code{.insn} directive tells @code{@value{AS}} that the following
data is actually instructions.  This makes a difference in nanoMIPS 16 and
microMIPS modes: when loading the address of a label which precedes
instructions, @code{@value{AS}} automatically adds 1 to the value, so
that jumping to the loaded address will do the right thing.

@kindex @code{.global}
The @code{.global} and @code{.globl} directives supported by
@code{@value{AS}} will by default mark the symbol as pointing to a
region of data not code.  This means that, for example, any
instructions following such a symbol will not be disassembled by
@code{objdump} as it will regard them as data.  To change this
behavior an optional section name can be placed after the symbol name
in the @code{.global} directive.  If this section exists and is known
to be a code section, then the symbol will be marked as pointing at
code not data.  Ie the syntax for the directive is:

  @code{.global @var{symbol}[ @var{section}][, @var{symbol}[ @var{section}]] ...},

Here is a short example:

@example
        .global foo .text, bar, baz .data
foo:
        nop
bar:
        .word 0x0
baz:
        .word 0x1

@end example

@end menu

@node nanoMIPS FP ABI Variants
@subsection Supported FP ABIs
The supported floating-point ABI variants are:

@table @code
@item 0 - No floating-point
This variant is used to indicate that floating-point is not used within
the module at all and therefore has no impact on the ABI.  This is the
default.

@item 1 - Double-precision
This variant indicates that double-precision support is used.  For 64-bit
ABIs this means that 64-bit wide floating-point registers are required.
For 32-bit ABIs this means that 32-bit wide floating-point registers are
required and double-precision operations use pairs of registers.

@item 2 - Single-precision
This variant indicates that single-precision support is used.  Double
precision operations will be supported via soft-float routines.

@item 3 - Soft-float
This variant indicates that although floating-point support is used all
operations are emulated in software.  This means the ABI is modified to
pass all floating-point data in general-purpose registers.

@end table

@node nanoMIPS FP ABI Compatibility
@subsection Linking different FP ABI variants
<FIXME>

@node nanoMIPS Option Stack
@section Directives to save and restore options

@cindex nanoMIPS option stack
@kindex @code{.set push}
@kindex @code{.set pop}
The directives @code{.set push} and @code{.set pop} may be used to save
and restore the current settings for all the options which are
controlled by @code{.set}.  The @code{.set push} directive saves the
current settings on a stack.  The @code{.set pop} directive pops the
stack and restores the settings.

These directives can be useful inside an macro which must change an
option such as the ISA level or instruction reordering but does not want
to change the state of the code which invoked the macro.

Traditional nanoMIPS assemblers do not support these directives.

@node nanoMIPS ASE Instruction Generation Overrides
@section Directives to control generation of nanoMIPS ASE instructions

@cindex nanoMIPS DSP Release 1 instruction generation override
@kindex @code{.set dsp}
@kindex @code{.set nodsp}
The directive @code{.set dsp} makes the assembler accept instructions

@kindex @code{.set virt}
@kindex @code{.set novirt}
The directive @code{.set virt} makes the assembler accept instructions
from the Virtualization Application Specific Extension from that point

@kindex @code{.set tlb}
@kindex @code{.set notlb}
The directive @code{.set tlb} makes the assembler accept instructions
from the TLB control Extension from that point on in the assembly.
The @code{.set notlb} directive prevents TLB control instructions from
being accepted.

@node nanoMIPS Floating-Point
@section Directives to override floating-point options

@cindex Disable floating-point instructions
@kindex @code{.set softfloat}
@kindex @code{.set hardfloat}
The directives @code{.set softfloat} and @code{.set hardfloat} provide
finer control of disabling and enabling float-point instructions.
These directives always override the default (that hard-float
instructions are accepted) or the command-line options
(@samp{-msoft-float} and @samp{-mhard-float}).

@cindex Disable single-precision floating-point operations
@kindex @code{.set singlefloat}
@kindex @code{.set doublefloat}
